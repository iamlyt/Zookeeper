# Zookeeper

## Overview

User-friendly project that is meant for zoo staff. 
This program understands the habitat's numbers, show the animals, and work continuosly without having to be restarted. 

This project helped me understand some syntax basics and learn how to work with variables, data storage types such as arrays, and while loops.
